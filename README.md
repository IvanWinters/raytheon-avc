# arUco-detection visproc directory instructions

## Setting up Virtual Environment (Necessary)

- Open terminal and type

```
python -m venv ./venv
```

(You may need to type python3 instead of python)

- You should see a new folder called venv appear in your directory
- You should be able to find a file called activate/activate.bat
- If you are on MAC or using a git Bash terminal
  - Type source ./venv/<path to "activate" file>

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

- If you are using cmd or PowerShell - Type .\venv\<path to "activate" file>
  You should get some indicator that says (venv in your terminal),
  you can often check to make sure it worked by typing pip -V and checking that the output file path corresponds
  to your current directory
